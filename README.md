## ✅ **MVP**

**Web:**

1. Two user types: `owner`s  and `renter`s

2. `user` can login and create a profile

3. `user` can then setup items they have `for rent` such as cameras, TV's, party equipment such as speakers/fog machines, etc.

4. `user` will be able to create, read, update and delete rental data. A second `user` can login and see `items` that users have `for rent` and ask to `rent` an `item`
